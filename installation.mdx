## Available Commands

paqet is a multi-command application. The primary command is `run`, which starts the proxy, but several utility commands are included to help with configuration and debugging.

The general syntax is:

```bash
sudo ./paqet <command> [arguments]
```

| Command   | Description                                                                      |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run`     | Starts the paqet client or server proxy. This is the main operational command. |
| `secret`  | Generates a new, cryptographically secure secret key.                            |
| `ping`    | Sends a single test packet to the server to verify connectivity.                |
| `dump`    | A diagnostic tool similar to `tcpdump` that captures and decodes packets.        |
| `version` | Prints the application's version information.                                    |

## Verifying Installation

To verify that paqet is installed correctly, run:

```bash
sudo ./paqet version
```

This should display the version information for paqet.
