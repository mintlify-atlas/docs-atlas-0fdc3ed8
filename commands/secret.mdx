The `secret` command generates a cryptographically secure random key for encrypting paqet traffic.

## Syntax

```bash
paqet secret
```

## Description

This command generates a 32-byte (256-bit) cryptographically secure random key and prints it in hexadecimal format. The key is generated using Go's `crypto/rand` package, which provides secure random number generation suitable for cryptographic purposes.

## What It Generates

- **Key Length**: 32 bytes (256 bits)
- **Format**: Hexadecimal string (64 characters)
- **Randomness**: Cryptographically secure random bytes

## Usage Example

```bash
paqet secret
```

### Example Output

```
7f3c8a9e1b4d6f2a8c5e9d7b3f1a4c8e6d2f9b7a5c3e1d8f6a4b2c9e7d5f3a1b
```

## Where to Use the Key

Copy the generated key and paste it into your `config.yaml` file under the `encryption.key` field:

```yaml
encryption:
  key: "7f3c8a9e1b4d6f2a8c5e9d7b3f1a4c8e6d2f9b7a5c3e1d8f6a4b2c9e7d5f3a1b"
  algorithm: "chacha20poly1305"
```

<Warning>
  **Keep your key secure**: This encryption key protects all traffic between your paqet client and server. Store it securely and never commit it to version control. Use the same key on both client and server for them to communicate.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Generate a new key for each deployment or environment. Don't reuse keys across different paqet installations.
</Note>

## Security Best Practices

1. Generate a unique key for each client-server pair
2. Store keys securely (use environment variables or secret management systems)
3. Rotate keys periodically
4. Never share keys over insecure channels
5. Add `config.yaml` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

<Info>
  The key is used with the ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption algorithm to ensure both confidentiality and integrity of your traffic.
