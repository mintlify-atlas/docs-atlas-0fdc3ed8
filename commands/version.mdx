## Platform Identifiers

Common platform values:

- `linux/amd64`: 64-bit Linux (most servers)

## Version Compatibility

For best results:

- Use the same version of paqet on both client and server
- Update both sides simultaneously when upgrading
- Check release notes for breaking changes between versions

<Warning>
  Running different versions of paqet on client and server may cause protocol incompatibilities, especially across major version boundaries.
