title: "dump"
description: "Capture and display raw TCP packets for debugging"
---

The `dump` command is a packet capture tool that logs incoming TCP packets with their payloads, similar to tcpdump but specifically designed for paqet traffic.

## Syntax

```bash
paqet dump [flags]
```

## Description

The `dump` command captures and displays raw TCP packets arriving on the configured port. It shows packet details including source address, destination address, timestamp, payload length, and a hex dump of the payload data. This is invaluable for debugging connection issues, verifying packet delivery, and analyzing traffic patterns.

<Note>
  The `dump` command requires a server configuration file and will listen on the port specified in the server config.
</Note>

## Flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--config` | `-c` | `config.yaml` | Path to the server configuration file |

## Usage Examples

### Start packet capture

```bash
sudo paqet dump -c server-config.yaml
```

### Capture with custom config location

```bash
sudo paqet dump -c /etc/paqet/server.yaml
```

## Example Output

```

<Warning>
  **Root privileges required**: The `dump` command requires sudo/root access to capture raw packets from the network interface.
</Warning>

## When to Use Dump

Use the `dump` command for:

- **Debugging connectivity**: Verify that packets are arriving at the server
- **Testing client ping**: Monitor the server while running `paqet ping` from a client
- **Analyzing traffic**: Inspect packet payloads to debug protocol issues
- **Verifying encryption**: Check that payloads are properly encrypted (should look random)
- **Network diagnostics**: Identify packet loss or routing problems

## What You'll See

Each captured packet displays:

1. **Timestamp**: Time the packet was received (HH:MM:SS.mmm)
2. **Source Address**: IP and port of the sender
3. **Destination Address**: IP and port where packet was received
4. **Length**: Size of the payload in bytes
5. **Hex Dump**: Complete payload in hexadecimal and ASCII format

<Info>
  Encrypted paqet traffic will appear as random binary data in the hex dump. If you see readable text (other than test pings), encryption may not be working correctly.
</Info>

## Stopping the Capture

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop capturing and exit gracefully:

```
^C
Shutdown signal received, exiting.
```

## Comparison to tcpdump

Unlike tcpdump, `paqet dump`:

- Works specifically with paqet's raw socket layer
- Respects your paqet configuration (interface, addresses)
- Shows only the application payload, not full TCP headers
- Formats output for easy debugging of paqet-specific issues

<Note>
  For full packet analysis including TCP/IP headers, use tcpdump or Wireshark. Use `paqet dump` when you want to quickly verify paqet-level packet delivery.
