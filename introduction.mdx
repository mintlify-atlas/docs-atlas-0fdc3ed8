# What is paqet?

paqet is a bidirectional packet level proxy built using raw sockets. It forwards traffic from a local client to a remote server, bypassing the host operating system's TCP/IP stack, using KCP for secure, reliable transport.

<Warning>
  **Development Status Notice**
  
  This project is in **active development**. APIs, configuration formats, and interfaces may change without notice. Use with caution in production environments.
</Warning>

## How It Works

paqet captures packets using `pcap` and injects crafted TCP packets containing encrypted transport data. KCP provides reliable, encrypted communication optimized for high-loss networks using aggressive retransmission, forward error correction, and symmetric encryption.

```
[Your App] <------> [paqet Client] <===== Raw TCP Packet =====> [paqet Server] <------> [Target Server]
(e.g. curl)        (localhost:1080)        (Internet)          (Public IP:PORT)     (e.g. https://httpbin.org)
```

## Use Cases

paqet use cases include:

- Bypassing firewalls that detect standard handshake protocols and kernel-level connection tracking
- Network security research
- Scenarios requiring granular control at the packet level

<Info>
  While more complex to configure than general-purpose VPN solutions, paqet offers granular control at the packet level.

## Architecture

paqet uses `pcap` to hook in at a much lower level than traditional applications. It requests a copy of every packet directly from the network driver, before the main OS TCP/IP stack and firewall get to process it.

This means traditional firewall rules (like `ufw deny <PORT>`) will have no effect on the proxy's operation, as paqet receives and processes the packet before the firewall can block it.
